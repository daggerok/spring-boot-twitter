= spring-boot-twitter image:https://travis-ci.org/daggerok/spring-boot-twitter.svg?branch=async-data-flow-pipeline-messaging-microservices["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/daggerok/spring-boot-twitter"]

this is repo containing (async `RabbitMQ messaging` and sync `REST` microservices) data models processing:

. main idea here is: each microservice doing single simple job, but doing it well, efficient and fast
. actor 1: `twitter-data` - single service which is listenning creation entity command (event) and store input data into RDBMS (Postgre SQL)
. actor 2: scalable `twitter-commander` service, which is send async tweets creation commands
. actor 3: scalable `twitter-query` service, which is only reading tweets from read-only datasorce. in production systems should be moved out from operational RDBMS to some nosql scalable / replicateble solution, such mongodb, or any other more siutable for you
. in addition: common reusable subprojects, such domain and entity api...
. important keywords:
  - CQRS, event sourcing
  - reactive streams, event-driven architecture
  - messaging pipelines, non-blocking data processing

== reads (can be improoved by spring 5 reactive programming model using Mono / Flux)

[source]
----
[client] <-> (http get) <-> [twitter-query] <-> (jdbc select) <-> [rdbms]

# with webflux and reactive data-source could also be non blocking:
[client] <~> (http get sse) <~> [twitter-query (webflux)] <~> (reactive flux) <~> [mongo]
----

== writes (also can be improved by replacing rdbms solution with some siutable reactive nosql)

[source]
----
[client] -> (http post) -> [twitter-command] ~> (send async) ~> [twitter-data] <-> (jdbc insert) <-> [rdbms]
----

note:

. `\<\->` - sync processing
. `<~>` - async processing

== quick start

[source,bash]
----
gradle --parallel bootRun
